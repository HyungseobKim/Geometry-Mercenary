HOW TO PLAY

This game uses only mouse input. Therefore, you cannot use a keyboard or console controller during gameplay.

The game consists of twelve levels, and three of them are boss levels. The player's objective is to clear all levels.
If players defeat on a level, players will still move on to the next level but lose their health.
If the player's health goes zero before clearing all levels, the player will lose, and the game ends.

Each level is a battle against eleven units of enemies. Players also will use the same number of units.
For both sides, there is a goal unit that cannot do anything.
The side that succeeds in killing the opponent's goal unit before losing their goal will be a winner.

At the start of each game, players will receive fifteen units with random status. Players can use only ten of them for each battle.
After players assign a class for every unit, they will enter the first level.
Players cannot change their class during gameplay, but players can upgrade them with items.
Players can acquire an item each time they succeed to pass one level, and items give one additional ability with bonuses.
Players can get an item no matter they win or lose, but there is a difference in options.
Players can upgrade each unit twice at most and change units to upgrade freely.
